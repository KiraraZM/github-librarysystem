# Simple Library System

This is just my simple project that im working on

book records
-get all record (done)
-ADD new record (done)
-DELETE record (done)
-Update record (done)


cannot be seen in Github. as the file is .EJS  :(
database also in localhost. although it should work. but i have provided database image for it just to visual.

at this time only 2 tables are currently used.

the other tables still just an idea
